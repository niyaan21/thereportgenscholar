## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd foss-ai # or your project directory
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project and add your API keys. This is **required** for the application to function.
    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration (replace with your actual Firebase project config)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project-id.firebaseapp.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project-id.appspot.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="123456789012"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:123456789012:web:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    # Google AI API Key for Genkit (REQUIRED for AI features)
    # Get your key from your Google Cloud project with the "Generative Language API" enabled.
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key_here"
    ```
    The application is configured to read these variables. Ensure they are correctly set for all features to work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

After installation, if you added `patch-package`:
```bash
npm run postinstall
# or
# yarn postinstall
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Development Server

Foss AI requires two development servers to run concurrently: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Next.js Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the Next.js app on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `package.json`, e.g., 9002).

2.  **Start the Genkit Development Server:**
    Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for auto-reloading on flow changes:
    # npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This starts the Genkit development server, usually on `http://localhost:3100`, making your AI flows available for inspection and testing. The Next.js app will call these flows server-side.

    Ensure both servers are running to use all AI features.

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

1.  **Build the Next.js Application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the Production Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    For Genkit flows in production, you'll typically deploy them as part of your backend (e.g., to Firebase Functions, Cloud Run, or Netlify Functions). Refer to the Deployment section below.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment to platforms like Netlify or Vercel that support Next.js.

### Deploying to Netlify

This project includes a `netlify.toml` file which configures the project to be deployed seamlessly on Netlify.

1.  **Push to a Git Repository:** Make sure your project is on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2.  **Create a New Site on Netlify:** Log in to Netlify and click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project".
3.  **Connect to Your Git Provider:** Select your Git provider and choose your project's repository.
4.  **Configure Build Settings:** Netlify should automatically detect that this is a Next.js project and use the settings from `netlify.toml`. The build command will be `npm run build` and the publish directory will be `.next`.
5.  **Add Environment Variables:** This is a crucial step.
    *   Go to your new site's settings: "Site configuration" -> "Environment variables".
    *   Click "Add a variable" and add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
    *   Add all of your `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables one by one.
6.  **Deploy:** Click "Deploy site". Netlify will start the build process and deploy your application. The Genkit flows will be automatically deployed as serverless Netlify Functions thanks to the Next.js runtime.

## üß† AI Functionality (Genkit)

Foss AI uses **Genkit for Firebase** to integrate with Google's Gemini AI models. The core AI logic is encapsulated in "flows" located in `src/ai/flows/`. These flows are server-side functions that handle tasks like:

*   `formulate-research-query.ts`: Takes a user's research question and generates optimized search queries, alternative phrasings, key concepts, and sub-topics.
*   `summarize-research-papers.ts`: (Conceptual) Takes paper abstracts/queries and synthesizes a summary.
*   `generate-research-report.ts`: Generates a detailed, multi-section academic-style report based on a research question and an optional summary.
*   `generate-report-from-file.ts`: Generates a report based on an uploaded file and user guidance.
*   `generate-daily-prompt-flow.ts`: Creates a "Prompt of the Day" for the dashboard.
*   `extract-mindmap-concepts.ts`: Extracts key concepts and a main idea from text for mind mapping.
*   `transcribe-and-analyze-flow.ts`: Transcribes audio/video files and performs thematic analysis.
*   `text-to-speech-flow.ts`: Converts text from report sections into playable audio.
*   `plagiarism-check-flow.ts`: Performs an AI-powered originality analysis on text, identifying similar sentences and citing likely real-world sources.

These flows are called by Next.js Server Actions defined in `src/app/actions.ts`.

## üîê Authentication

User authentication is handled by **Firebase Authentication**, supporting:
*   Email & Password sign-up and login.
*   Sign in with Google.

Authenticated users can access core features and manage their account settings.
