## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd foss-ai # or your project directory
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project and add your API keys. This is **required** for the application to function.
    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration (replace with your actual Firebase project config)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project-id.firebaseapp.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project-id.appspot.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="123456789012"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:123456789012:web:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    # Google AI API Key(s) for Genkit (REQUIRED for AI features)
    # Get your keys from your Google Cloud project with the "Generative Language API" enabled.
    # The application is configured to use a pool of keys for reliability.
    GEMINI_API_KEY_1="your_first_google_ai_key"
    GEMINI_API_KEY_2="your_second_google_ai_key"
    GEMINI_API_KEY_3="your_third_google_ai_key"
    # You can add more keys (GEMINI_API_KEY_4, etc.)
    ```
    The application is configured to read these variables. Ensure they are correctly set for all features to work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Development Server

Foss AI requires two development servers to run concurrently: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Next.js Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the Next.js app on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Genkit Development Server:**
    Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for auto-reloading on flow changes:
    # npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This starts the Genkit development server, usually on `http://localhost:3100`, making your AI flows available for inspection and testing. The Next.js app will call these flows server-side.

    Ensure both servers are running to use all AI features.

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production server, run:
```bash
npm run start
```

## üöÄ Deployment to Netlify

This project is configured for easy deployment on Netlify.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION: CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT STEP**
> The most common reason for deployment errors (like "Unexpected response" or "API configuration issue") is missing environment variables on Netlify. Your local `.env` file is **NOT** uploaded. You **MUST** add your Firebase and Gemini API keys to the Netlify UI for the live application to work. Please follow the instructions in Step 3 carefully.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Connect Your Git Repository:** Log in to Netlify, click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project", and connect to the GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository containing your code.
2.  **Build Settings:** Netlify will automatically detect this is a Next.js project. The settings in `netlify.toml` will be used (`npm run build` command, `.next` publish directory). You shouldn't need to change anything here.
3.  **Add Environment Variables (CRITICAL):** This is the most important step for the deployed app to work. Your local `.env` file is NOT uploaded to Netlify. You must add the variables manually in the Netlify UI.
    *   In your Netlify site, go to **Site configuration > Environment variables**.
    *   Click **Add a variable**.
    *   Add each variable from your `.env` file one by one. It is crucial that the names match exactly.
    *   **`GEMINI_API_KEY_1`**: Add this variable with your first Google AI key.
    *   **`GEMINI_API_KEY_2`**: Add this variable with your second Google AI key.
    *   **`GEMINI_API_KEY_3`**: Add this variable with your third Google AI key.
        *   *(You can add more, e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY_4`, `GEMINI_API_KEY_5`, etc.)*
    *   **Firebase Variables**: Add all the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables from your `.env` file.
4.  **Deploy Site:** Click the "Deploy site" button. Netlify will build and deploy your application.

### Troubleshooting Deployment Errors

*   **Error: "API configuration issue" or "Unexpected response"**: This error almost always means your **environment variables were not set correctly on Netlify**.
    1.  Go back to **Site configuration > Environment variables** in Netlify.
    2.  Double-check that you have added `GEMINI_API_KEY_1` (and any others) and all `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables.
    3.  Verify that there are no typos in the variable names or their values.
    4.  After adding/correcting the variables, you must **re-deploy** your site. Go to the "Deploys" tab and trigger a new deploy.

## üß† AI Functionality (Genkit)

Foss AI uses **Genkit for Firebase** to integrate with Google's Gemini AI models. The core AI logic is encapsulated in "flows" located in `src/ai/flows/`. These flows are server-side functions that handle tasks like:

*   `formulate-research-query.ts`: Takes a user's research question and generates optimized search queries, alternative phrasings, key concepts, and sub-topics.
*   `summarize-research-papers.ts`: (Conceptual) Takes paper abstracts/queries and synthesizes a summary.
*   `generate-research-report.ts`: Generates a detailed, multi-section academic-style report based on a research question and an optional summary.
*   `generate-report-from-file.ts`: Generates a report based on an uploaded file and user guidance.
*   `generate-daily-prompt-flow.ts`: Creates a "Prompt of the Day" for the dashboard.
*   `extract-mindmap-concepts.ts`: Extracts key concepts and a main idea from text for mind mapping.
*   `transcribe-and-analyze-flow.ts`: Transcribes audio/video files and performs thematic analysis.
*   `plagiarism-check-flow.ts`: Performs an AI-powered originality analysis on text, identifying similar sentences and citing likely real-world sources.

These flows are called by Next.js Server Actions defined in `src/app/actions.ts`.

## üîê Authentication
